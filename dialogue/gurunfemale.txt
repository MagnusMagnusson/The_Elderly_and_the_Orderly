Leave me alone
I aint got time for that
stop poking me
I think i am sick
I think i need to go to the hospital 
i am not a hypocondriac
i think i have lupus 
i hate spiders
my kids are visiting tomorrow
my hip hurtws
i was a gymnist
i once walked into a wall
my first boyfriend was a doctor
my second boyfriend is in prison
my current boyfriend is an orderly
